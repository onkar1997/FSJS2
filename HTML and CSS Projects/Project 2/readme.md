# PROJECT 2 - Crypto Market

## Workflow:

1. First, I created project folder for first project and opened in the vscode editor and created one folder for storing images and two files: index.html, style.css inside the main project folder. 
2. Then I linked my css file to index file and now I was ready to code, all setup was done.
3. I Chose the **layman** approach to solve the task. I started to build the website from top to down apporach. Started with the navbar and then hero section and futher and at last footer.
4. The project is not mobile responsive as of now. But soon it will be.
5. The project is live on **Netlify - [Click Here](https://seomaster-htmlcss.netlify.app/)**
