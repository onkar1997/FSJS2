# PROJECT 1 - VISUAL STUDIO CODE CLONE

## A VSCode Editor clone built using Tailwind CSS 

### Workflow:

1. First, I created project folder for tailwind css and opened in the vscode editor and created one index.html file.
2. Then I visited [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/) website and in the **docs** section I copied the **script tag** of tailwind and pasted it in my **head tag* of index file and now I was ready to code, all setup was done.
3. I Chose the **layman** approach to solve the task. I started to build the website from top to down apporach. Started with the navbar and then hero section and futher and at last footer.
4. The project is not mobile responsive as of now. But soon it will be.
5. The project is live on **Netlify - [Click Here](https://vscode-tailwind-site.netlify.app/)**
